# RGD JBrowse Reference Sequence Track

## Overview

The Reference Sequence Track in JBrowse displays DNA sequences and their six-frame translations when sufficiently zoomed in.

## Zooming Requirements

Users must zoom in sufficiently before sequences display. A message stating "Zoom in to see sequence" appears when zoomed out too far. Zoom using magnifying glass icons or by clicking and dragging the detail section's position bar.

## Display Levels

### Color-Coded Blocks (Moderate Zoom)

At moderate zoom levels, the DNA track displays color-coded blocks without base letter labels:

| Nucleotide | Color |
|-----------|-------|
| A (Adenine) | Green |
| C (Cytosine) | Blue |
| G (Guanine) | Yellow |
| T (Thymine) | Red |

The display shows all start and stop codons across six reading frames as colored blocks in grey lines above (forward strand) and below (reverse strand) the sequence.

### Detailed Sequence Display (High Zoom)

Further zooming reveals both DNA sequences and putative amino acid sequences in all three reading frames for both directions (six total reading frames). Amino acids are shown using single-letter abbreviations corresponding to three-base DNA codons.

## Downloading Sequence Data

Users can save sequences as FASTA files:

1. Click the down arrow in the track label
2. Select "Save Track Data"
3. Optionally rename the file
4. Choose to view or download to your computer

This function allows downloading regions up to approximately 500 kilobases.

## Tips

- The reference sequence track is essential for viewing nucleotide-level detail
- Use this track in combination with gene and transcript tracks to examine exon/intron boundaries
- The six-frame translation is useful for identifying open reading frames and potential coding regions
- For large sequence exports, consider using the RGD FTP site instead
