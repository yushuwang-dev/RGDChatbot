# RGD Gene Nomenclature

## Overview

Accurate nomenclature is an increasingly indispensable tool used to disambiguate genetic objects such as genes, QTLs, and strains. Standardized biological nomenclature is a valuable and ever-expanding tool that researchers can use to reliably retrieve data and research the genome through analysis tools available within RGD.

## Nomenclature Guidelines

For detailed nomenclature guidelines, visit the RGD Nomenclature Information page accessible from the Community section of the RGD website.

## Key Principles

### Rat Gene Nomenclature
- Gene symbols are italicized and written with only the first letter capitalized (e.g., *Brca1*)
- Gene names are written in lowercase, not italicized (e.g., BRCA1 DNA repair associated)
- Protein symbols are written in all uppercase, not italicized (e.g., BRCA1)

### Human Gene Nomenclature
- Gene symbols are italicized and written in all uppercase (e.g., *BRCA1*)
- Coordinated by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC)

### Mouse Gene Nomenclature
- Gene symbols are italicized with only the first letter capitalized (e.g., *Brca1*)
- Coordinated by Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI)

## Cross-Species Coordination

RGD collaborates with Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) and the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) for assigning gene symbols and names across rat, human, and mouse orthologs. This collaboration ensures:

- Consistent naming across species for orthologous genes
- Proper assignment of new gene symbols
- Resolution of nomenclature conflicts
- Maintenance of historical nomenclature records

## Educational Resources

RGD provides video tutorials on biological nomenclature:

### Part I: The History and Reasoning Behind Biological Nomenclature
Covers the background and importance of standardized nomenclature systems in genetic research.

### Part II: Gene Nomenclature
Explains rat, mouse, and human gene nomenclature, particularly how it is assigned and where researchers can go to seek help when naming their genes.
