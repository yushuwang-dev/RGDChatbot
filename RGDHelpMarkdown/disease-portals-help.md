# RGD Disease Portals Help

## Overview

The Rat Genome Database offers disease portals enabling exploration of relationships between diseases and genes, QTLs, and strains across multiple species.

## Available Disease Portals

RGD maintains 16 disease-specific portals:

1. Aging & Age-Related Disease
2. Behavioral & Substance Use Disorder
3. Cancer & Neoplastic Disease
4. Cardiovascular Disease
5. Coronavirus Disease
6. Developmental Disease
7. Diabetes
8. Hematologic Disease
9. Immune & Inflammatory Disease
10. Infectious Disease
11. Liver Disease
12. Neurological Disease
13. Obesity & Metabolic Syndrome
14. Renal Disease
15. Respiratory Disease
16. Sensory Organ Disease

## Disease Portals Landing Page

The entry page displays all available disease portals with clickable icons and titles. Users can:
- Click corresponding icons or titles to enter each portal
- Download tab-delimited text files of disease annotations

## Portal Features

### Ontology, Species and Term Selection

- **Ontology Selection** - Choose from nine available ontologies (default is disease section)
- **Species Selection** - Click species images to switch between organisms
- **Annotation Counts** - Display gene, QTL, and strain annotation numbers for selected terms
- **RGD Ontology Browser** - Navigate and select desired terms; changing selections updates counts
- **Downloadable Lists** - Gene, QTL, and strain lists annotated to chosen terms

### GViewer Display

When available, shows chromosome complement visualization with color-coded features:
- **Brown** - Genes
- **Blue** - QTLs
- **Green** - Strains

Users can click objects to view horizontal close-up displays and navigate chromosomes. Clicking objects links to corresponding report pages.

### Term Enrichment and Analysis Tools

Each portal provides access to:
- **MOET** (Multi-Ontology Enrichment Tool) for gene enrichment results
- Various RGD and external analysis tools
- **Strain model finder** for annotated rat models
- RGD pathway data and external information sources

## Usage Tips

- Disease portals are the best starting point for disease-focused research
- Use the species tabs to compare gene/QTL/strain annotations across organisms
- The GViewer integration allows visual exploration of genomic positions
- Download features enable bulk data retrieval for further analysis
