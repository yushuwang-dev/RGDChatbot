# RGD Genome Browsers

## Overview

RGD provides genome browser tools for visualizing genomic data. The primary browser is JBrowse, which has replaced the legacy GBrowse browser.

**Important Note:** Both browsers were available during the transition period, but data in GBrowse is no longer updated. JBrowse is the recommended genome browser for all users.

## JBrowse

JBrowse is an interactive genome browser that displays genomic data as horizontal "tracks" containing specific types of data. It is available for multiple species and genome assemblies.

### Available Assemblies
- Rat: RGSC 3.4, RGSC 5.0, RGSC 6.0, mRatBN7.2
- Mouse: build 37
- Human: builds 36.3 and 37

### Key Features
- Interactive navigation with zoom and pan
- Multiple data track types (genes, QTLs, strains, variants, RNA-Seq)
- Track filtering and customization
- Data export capabilities
- Shareable URLs
- FASTA sequence extraction

## Track Categories

### Gene-related Tracks
- RGD Genes
- RGD Genes and Transcripts
- RGD Transcripts
- Disease-related gene tracks
- Gene-Chemical Interaction tracks
- RNA-Seq Gene Prediction tracks

### QTL and Strain Tracks
- RGD QTLs (blue box glyphs)
- RGD Congenic Strains (green box glyphs)

### Reference Sequence Track
- DNA sequence display with six-frame translations
- Color-coded nucleotide display (A=green, C=blue, G=yellow, T=red)

### Synteny Tracks
- Cross-species synteny blocks
- Color-coded by matching chromosome

### Variant Tracks
- Strain-specific variant tracks (SNVs and indels)
- dbSNP variant data
- Ensembl variant data
- Marker/SSLP tracks

### RNA-Seq Based Tracks
- BAM alignment displays
- Gene prediction tracks from RNA-Seq data

For detailed information on each track type, see the dedicated help documents.
