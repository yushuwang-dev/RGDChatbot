# RGD Ontology Browser Help

## Overview

The ontology browser shows a term's context through ancestors/paths, siblings, and children. Information is organized with the term summary at top, followed by three columns showing parent terms (left), selected term (center), and child terms (right). A graph view at the bottom displays ontology paths.

## Top Section - Term Information

Displayed elements include:
- **Term name** - The official name of the ontology term
- **Accession ID** - Usable for ontology general search
- **Definition** - Explanation of the term's meaning
- **Synonyms** - Including historical names and community-specific identifiers

Underlined terms and phrases link to additional information.

## Search Features

A search box allows ontology searches without leaving the browser. Users can initiate searches by pressing Enter or clicking the magnifying lens icon within an orange circle. A link allows users to go back to the main search page.

## Browse Function

Clicking "browse the term" on branch icons or underlined phrases directs users to the center column showing the ontology term with parent and child terms displayed on either side.

## Annotations View

A "white A in a red square" icon links to the Ontology Report - Annotations page. This displays all RGD objects annotated to the selected term. The standalone button provides identical functionality.

## Center Column - Term with Siblings

The highlighted yellow box displays the selected term and its definition. Sibling terms appear alphabetically in the same column. Parent terms populate the left column; child terms populate the right column.

## Graph View

An interactive diagram at the page bottom shows all paths and ancestor terms between the selected term and top-level terms. Users can browse by clicking terms within this graphic. This provides a visual representation of the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure.

## Navigation Tips

- Click any term in the parent or child columns to navigate the ontology hierarchy
- Use the graph view to understand the full context of a term's position in the ontology
- The accession ID can be used to search directly for a specific term
- Branch icons throughout the browser allow quick navigation to related terms
