# RGD Gene Search Help

## Quick Guide

1. Enter a search term in the "Keyword" text box under the "Gene Search" title
2. Click either "Search Genes" button to run the search
3. Limit search by chromosome, genomic coordinates, map, or species with options below the Keyword text box
4. Click either "Search Genes" button to run the search

**Access the search tool:** Navigate to the Gene Search page from the Data menu or the light blue Search bar.

## Sample Searches

Clicking one of the "Example searches" above the Keyword search box automatically initiates a search for that term.

## Detailed Search Form Elements

### Keyword

Enter a gene symbol, alias, or keyword to search. The asterisk `*` functions as a wildcard, with various other options available to refine searches.

### Chromosome

Restrict returned genes to ones mapped to a particular chromosome. Excludes unmapped genes or those mapped to different chromosomes.

### Start and Stop

Allows search restriction by genomic coordinates. Enter the beginning base pair coordinate in "Start" and ending coordinate in "Stop". Returns all genes, QTLs, and SSLPs bounded by those coordinates.

### Assembly

Restricts searches to genes on specific genome assemblies or genomic map types. A second dropdown allows inclusion or exclusion of unmapped objects.

### Species

Determines which tab is selected on the results page. Results for other species remain accessible via tabs on the results page. The default species is rat.

## Search Results

Results show genes matching the search term (highlighted in yellow), with accessible filters including:

- Matching alleles
- Protein-coding regions
- Pseudogenes
- Splice variants

Features include:
- Information header explaining additional display details
- Checkboxes for selecting multiple genes
- Links for downloading or analyzing with RGD tools
- Sorting by different parameters
- Genome assembly filtering
- Page view options

Clicking a gene symbol links to that gene's report page.

## Alternative Access

"Switch to classic gene search" link at bottom left provides access to an older gene search version with separate help documentation.
