# RGD Genes Help

## What is a Gene?

A gene is defined as the DNA sequence necessary and sufficient to express the complete complement of functional products derived from a unit of transcription.

## Gene Data in RGD

RGD gene report pages contain:

- Information manually annotated by curators from scientific literature
- Data from automated pipelines importing from other databases
- Splice variant listings with associated reports

### What Gene Reports Exclude

- Mutations (these are tracked separately)
- Pseudogenes (these have their own records)
- Protein products derived from precursor protein modification (for example, angiotensin, which is derived from Agt gene cleavage by Ren)

## Nomenclature Collaboration

RGD collaborates with Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) and the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) for assigning gene symbols and names across rat, human, and mouse orthologs. This ensures consistent naming conventions across species.
