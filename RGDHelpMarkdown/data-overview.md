# RGD Data Overview

## About RGD Data

The Rat Genome Database (RGD) is a comprehensive research resource providing access to rat genomic, genetic, and phenotypic data. RGD maintains data across multiple categories serving the biomedical research community.

## Data Categories

### Genes
Comprehensive gene information including symbols, names, descriptions, aliases, genomic positions, annotations, and cross-species orthologs. RGD stores gene data for ten species: rat, mouse, human, chinchilla, dog, bonobo, thirteen-lined ground squirrel, pig, green monkey, and naked mole rat.

### Variants
Genomic variant data including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions, deletions, and other structural variants across rat strains.

### QTLs (Quantitative Trait Loci)
Physical chromosomal locations containing alleles that differentially affect continuously distributed phenotypic traits. RGD curates rat and human QTLs and imports mouse QTLs from Mouse Genome Informatics.

### Strains
Information on laboratory rat strains including inbred, congenic, consomic, transgenic, mutant, outbred, and other strain types. Includes strain characteristics, phenotype annotations, and availability information.

### Markers
Genomic tools (SSLPs/microsatellites) used to localize genetic elements. RGD stores marker data including primer sequences, strain polymorphisms, and genomic positions.

### Genome Information
Reference genome assembly data and genomic coordinates for all RGD objects.

### Ontologies
RGD uses sixteen ontologies including Gene Ontology, Disease Ontology, Pathway Ontology, Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, Clinical Measurement Ontology, Measurement Method Ontology, Experimental Condition Ontology, Rat Strain Ontology, ChEBI, Human Phenotype Ontology, and Vertebrate Trait Ontology.

### Cell Lines
Cell line data associated with rat research.

### References
Scientific literature references including curated (manually reviewed) and uncurated references associated with RGD data objects.

### Download
Bulk data available through the RGD FTP site, updated twice monthly, covering genes, ESTs, QTLs, maps, SSLPs, RH Map v3.4, and alleles.
