# Rat Strain Definitions

## Overview

The Rat Genome Database provides comprehensive definitions for various rat strain types used in research. Understanding these strain types is essential for interpreting experimental results and selecting appropriate models.

## Strain Types

### Advanced Intercross Line
Advanced intercross strains are created by producing an F2 generation between two inbred strains, then intercrossing in each subsequent generation. This approach increases recombination events, allowing finer mapping resolution.

### Chromosome Altered
Rat strains grouped by alteration in the chromosome structure. This includes strains with specific chromosomal modifications.

### Coisogenic
Inbred strains that differ at only a single locus through mutation occurring in that strain. The mutation arises spontaneously within the inbred strain background.

### Congenic
Congenic strains result from repeated backcrosses to an inbred strain with selection for a particular marker from the donor strain. This process transfers a specific genomic region from one strain into the genetic background of another.

### Conplastic
Conplastic strains are strains in which the nuclear genome from one strain has been crossed onto the cytoplasm of the other. The mitochondrial donor is always the female parent during the backcrossing program. This allows study of mitochondrial genome effects.

### Consomic
Consomic strains are produced by repeated backcrossing of a whole chromosome onto an inbred strain. This replaces an entire chromosome from the recipient strain with the corresponding chromosome from the donor strain.

### Hybrid
Progeny of two inbred strains, crossed in the same direction, and are genetically identical. F1 hybrids are heterozygous at all loci where the parental strains differ.

### Inbred
An inbred strain has a defined background. It has been mated brother x sister for 20 or more consecutive generations, with average residual heterozygosity of 0.01. Examples include ACI, FHH, and BN strains. Inbred strains are essentially homozygous at all loci.

### Mutant
Animals with structural DNA changes including insertions, deletions, or chromosomal rearrangements generated spontaneously or artificially. These strains carry specific genetic modifications.

### Outbred
These animals are genetically undefined - they are bred with animals that are unrelated to each other, and not bred with siblings or close relatives. Outbred stocks maintain genetic diversity.

### Recombinant Inbred
Formed by crossing two inbred strains, followed by 20 or more consecutive generations of brother-sister mating. Each recombinant inbred line carries a unique combination of alleles from the two parental strains.

### Segregating Inbred
Inbred strains maintaining a particular allele or mutation in heterozygous state. This allows continued study of heterozygous effects.

### Transchromosomal Strain
Strains carrying a chromosome, chromosomal fragment, or engineered chromosome from another species as a separate, heritable entity. These strains are useful for cross-species functional studies.

### Transgenic
Animals that have a DNA fragment that has been stably introduced into the germline, which can be generated by a random insertion into the genome. Transgenic strains express foreign DNA sequences.

### Wild
Rats captured in the wild. These serve as reference points for understanding natural genetic variation compared to laboratory strains.
