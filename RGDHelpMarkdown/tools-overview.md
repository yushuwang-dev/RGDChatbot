# RGD Tools Overview

## Analysis and Visualization Tools

RGD provides a comprehensive suite of analysis and visualization tools for genomic research.

### OntoMate (Literature Search)
A literature search tool that helps researchers find relevant publications by querying ontology-based annotations.

### JBrowse (Genome Browser)
An interactive genome browser for viewing genomic data including genes, transcripts, QTLs, strains, variants, and RNA-Seq data. Available for multiple species and genome assemblies.

### Synteny Browser (VCMap)
A visual tool for comparing syntenic regions across species, helping researchers identify conserved genomic regions between rat, mouse, and human.

### Variant Visualizer
A tool for analyzing and visualizing genomic variants across rat strains, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions, and deletions.

### Multi-Ontology Enrichment Tool (MOET)
Analyzes gene lists to identify over-represented terms from RGD's ontologies (Disease, Pathway, Phenotype, GO, ChEBI). Based on the hypergeometric test.

### Gene-Ortholog Location Finder (GOLF)
Helps locate orthologous genes across species, providing cross-species genomic position information.

### InterViewer (Protein-Protein Interactions)
Visualizes known protein-protein interaction networks for selected genes.

### PhenoMiner (Quantitative Phenotypes)
An ontology-based tool for storage and analysis of quantitative phenotype data specific to laboratory rats. Uses four primary ontologies: Clinical Measurement, Measurement Method, Experimental Condition, and Rat Strain.

### Gene Annotator
Provides functional annotation analysis including annotation distribution and comparison capabilities for gene lists.

### OLGA (Object List Generator and Analyzer)
An advanced search tool for generating and analyzing lists of genes and other genomic objects based on complex criteria.

### AllianceMine
A data mining tool integrated with the Alliance of Genome Resources for cross-database queries.

### GViewer (Genome Viewer)
Displays genome-wide chromosome locations of genes and QTLs annotated to query results. Available as standalone and embedded versions.
