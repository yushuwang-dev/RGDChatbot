# RGD GViewer (Genome Viewer) Help

## Overview

The Genome Viewer (GViewer) tool provides diagrams displaying genome-wide chromosome locations of genes and QTLs annotated to query results. Users can view all objects, export data as CSV files, or overlay additional objects in resulting diagrams.

## Access Points

GViewer appears in multiple locations:
- Ontology report pages (embedded)
- General search results (via clickable link)
- Stand-alone tool with enhanced capabilities

## Stand-Alone GViewer Features

### Search Functionality
The search tool allows users to search by partial or exact ontology terms and filter results by checking boxes under ontology types.

### Diagram Display
Once a search completes, GViewer generates a diagram showing genomic positions of all rat genes and QTLs annotated with search term results.

**Color coding:**
- **Genes** - Dark red
- **QTLs** - Blue (positioned to the right of each chromosome)

### Zoom and Navigation
- Clicking a chromosome opens a zoom pane for closer examination
- A second click locks the slider in a fixed location
- Object report page links accessible by clicking symbols in the zoom pane

### Zoom Controls
Upper right of zoom pane contains:
- **Zoom in** - For closer inspection
- **Zoom out** - For broader view
- **Send to JBrowse** - Opens JBrowse genome browser for complete genomic data display

### List All Objects
Clicking this bottom-left link displays all diagram objects grouped by chromosome. Selecting an object symbol places it with flanking regions into the zoom pane.

### CSV Export
Allows data export with options for downloading:
- All objects
- Shared objects across multiple searches
- Unique objects

### Add Objects Function
Enables overlaying additional objects to current diagrams:
- Search for genes, QTLs, markers, or ontology terms
- Display results in customized colors
- Yellow coloring indicates previously displayed objects
