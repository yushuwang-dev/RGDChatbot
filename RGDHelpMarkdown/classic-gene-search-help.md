# RGD Classic Gene Search Help

## Quick Guide

1. Enter gene name, synonym, or symbol in the keyword box
2. Change the "Equals", chromosome, search, or species options to optimize the search
3. Access additional options for SSLPs, homologs, Gene Ontology terms, results order, and results per page in the "Options" section below basic search parameters
4. Click the "Find Gene" button to run the search

## Search Parameters

### Gene Symbol/Alias/Keyword

Enter a gene symbol, alias, or keyword in the text box. The asterisk `*` functions as an accepted wildcard. Use the drop-down menu to refine the search with other options.

### Chromosome

Restrict returned genes to ones mapped to a particular chromosome. This excludes genes that are unmapped or mapped to a different chromosome.

### Search

This option allows restriction of searched fields and hence the scope of returned results. Available options include:

- **Current Symbols** - Narrowest search
- **Current Symbols/Names** - Searches both symbols and names
- **Current and Withdrawn** - Includes withdrawn gene records
- **Current & Withdrawn & Aliases** - Broadest and default search option

## Options

### Limit to genes with associated SSLPs

Restricts returned genes to ones that have SSLPs (microsatellite markers) associated with them. Associated SSLPs are believed to be in linkage disequilibrium with the gene itself and hence serve as markers for the gene on genetic and RH maps.

### Limit to genes with known Homologs

Restricts returned genes to ones which have a known homolog (mouse or human) listed in RGD.

### Limit to genes annotated to ontology term

Restricts returned genes to ones that have been annotated to the entered Gene Ontology term.

### Results ordered by

- **Symbol** - Results listed alphabetically by gene symbol
- **Name** - Results listed alphabetically by gene name
- **Chromosome** - Results listed by chromosome then alphabetically by gene symbol

### Results per page

Defines the number of genes returned on each results page.
