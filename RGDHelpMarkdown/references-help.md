# RGD References Help

## Overview

Much of RGD's data originates from scientific literature. The reference search functionality allows users to retrieve curated articles with titles, abstracts, and citations.

## Reference Types

- **Curated references** - Manually reviewed by curation staff with extracted relevant information added to the database
- **Uncurated references** - Known to contain relevant data but not yet manually reviewed; found as PubMed links in object reports

## Reference Search

### Accessing the Search
Mouse over "Data" in the top banner and click "References" in the dropdown, or navigate via the RGD Data page.

### Search Parameters
- Any word or word fragment in title or abstract
- Author's last name
- Year of publication (coupled with another search term)
- Case-insensitive searches
- Asterisks function as wildcards

## Reference Search Results

The results display includes:
- List of references matching search terms (highlighted in yellow)
- Title, Citation, Authors, RGD ID, and "Matched By" field (all linked to reference report pages)
- Excel Download option for exporting selected references via checkboxes

## Reference Report Page

Clicking on Title, Citation, Authors, RGD ID, or Matched By opens a new tab with:

### General Tab
- Authors, citation, RGD ID, PubMed ID
- Links to PubMed ("View article at PubMed")
- DOI link ("Full-text" link)

### Annotation Section
- Disease Annotations
- Phenotype Annotations
- Objects Annotated (genes, strains, QTLs) if curated
- Evidence codes linked to annotation report pages

## Disease/Phenotype Annotation Report Pages

Clicking disease or phenotype terms shows linked annotation pages with:

### "View as List" Tab (Default)
- Evidence code information
- Citation details
- Number of annotations and objects annotated
- Papers annotated to objects
- Curation notes when present

### "View As Table" Tab
- Tabular format display
- Term, Definition, and Definition Source(s)

## Objects Section

Scrolling or clicking "Objects Annotated" displays:
- Genes, QTLs, and Strains linked to the reference
- Links to respective report pages
- "Objects referenced in this article" section showing all referenced markers and objects
