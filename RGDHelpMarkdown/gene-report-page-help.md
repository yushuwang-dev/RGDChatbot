# RGD Gene Report Page Help

## Overview

This document describes the information sections available on RGD gene report pages. Not all sections appear for every gene - sections display only when relevant data exists.

## Accessing Gene Report Pages

### Method 1: Search Box
Enter a case-insensitive gene symbol or name into the "Search Term" box on the RGD front page and press enter or click the magnifying glass icon.

### Method 2: Data Menu
Click "Genes" in the "Data" pulldown in the black toolbar.

### Method 3: Search Bar
Click "Genes" in the light blue Search bar.

### Search Results Process
The "Search Term" method leads to an intermediate results page displaying objects across ten RGD species, ontology terms, or references matching the query. Clicking highlighted numbers or phrases links to category-specific match lists.

### Gene Search Page
The second and third methods lead to the Gene Search page where users can:
- Type gene symbols, names, or ID numbers
- Press "Enter" or click "Search Genes"
- Limit searches by chromosome, start/stop base pair coordinates, and species (rat is default)

### Search Results Display
Results show genes matching the search term (highlighted in yellow), with accessible filters including matching alleles, protein-coding regions, pseudogenes, and splice variants. Clicking a gene symbol links to that gene's report page.

## Gene Report Page Summary

### Gene Header Information
The official gene symbol, official gene name, species name, and species picture are prominently displayed at the top.

### Page Navigation
A floating outline on the left shows report page sections and subsections. The currently viewed section is highlighted in dark blue. Sections can be accessed by clicking titles or scrolling.

### Tabs
- **General Tab** - Selected by default, contains most RGD gene information
- **Array IDs Tab** - Appears for genes with microarray IDs; contains microarray probe IDs from Affymetrix and Ensembl sources

### Description Section
An automated, current synopsis synthesizing specific gene information based on annotations including:
- Function
- Processes
- Pathways
- Cellular location
- Associated diseases
- Associated phenotypes
- Chemical interactions

Information derives from experimental evidence or inference from rat, mouse, or human orthologs.

### Gene Type
A one-word designation indicating whether the gene is protein-coding, pseudogene, splice variant, or allele. Links to parent gene pages appear when applicable.

### RefSeq Status
One-word code related to and linked with the NCBI RefSeq record and GenBank sequence data.

### Also Known As
Symbols and synonyms currently or historically used to reference the gene.

## Orthologs and Related Data

### RGD Orthologs
RGD stores data for genes from ten species:
- Rat
- Mouse
- Human
- Chinchilla
- Dog
- Bonobo
- Thirteen-lined ground squirrel
- Pig
- Green monkey
- Naked mole rat

The "RGD Orthologs" line displays icons representing all available orthologs. Hovering shows species common names; clicking links to corresponding RGD gene report pages.

### Alliance Genes
Icon links to member species orthologous gene pages at the Alliance for Genomic Resources.

### More Info Section
Expanding the gray box reveals additional information about RGD and Alliance orthologs.

### Is Marker For
Lists strains and QTLs where the gene or mutant version serves as a marker, with links to report pages.

### Allele/Splice
Links to mutant allele and splice variant report pages (when available).

### Genetic Models
Displays rat mutant model strains with links to report pages.

### Latest Assembly
Indicates the current genome assembly (for rat: mRatBN7.2).

### Position
Gene chromosomal coordinates displayed for each genome assembly, with current assembly highlighted and linked to NCBI information pages. Includes assembly source and genome browser links.

### JBrowse
Provides a link to JBrowse showing the chromosomal gene region, accessible via "Full-screen view" in the sample JBrowse window.

## Annotation Section

### Overview
Annotations using six ontologies display in "Annotation Detail View" by default, with a summary view option available.

### Display Features
- 20 annotations displayed by default (fewer if fewer exist)
- Total annotation count indicated
- Blue arrows for scrolling
- Pulldown to change display number
- "Search table" box to filter by any word, phrase, or number

### Organization
Annotations ordered alphabetically by term; sortable alphabetically or numerically by any category using black arrows.

### Annotation Components
Each annotation line includes:
- **Term** - Linked to annotation report page
- **Qualifier** - Additional context for the annotation
- **Evidence code** - Type of evidence supporting the annotation
- **With** - Typically species RGD ID
- **Reference** - Linked to manuscript or pipeline information page
- **Notes** - Additional annotation notes
- **Source** - Database source field
- **Original Reference(s)** - For imported annotations

### Navigation Persistence
Report page configuration persists when navigating away and returning.

## References Section

### Curated References
References used to make annotations, reviewed by RGD curation staff.

### Additional References
Uncurated references associated with the gene but not yet manually reviewed.

All references link to PubMed abstracts and manuscripts.

## Genomics Section

### Candidate Gene Status
Displays when the gene is a candidate for one or more QTLs, with links to report pages.

### Comparative Map Data
Shows genome assembly information for all RGD-housed species, similar to the Position section.

### Position Markers
Shows genome information for markers associated with the gene, with links to report pages.

### QTLs in Region (mRatBN7.2)
Downloadable list of overlapping QTLs with links to report pages. Presents information in a searchable, sortable section.

### miRNA Target Status
Provides downloadable information on miRNAs predicted to target the gene.

## Expression Section

Shows RNA-SEQ expression data at four pre-defined levels across several biological systems. Numbers in each category link to data subsets. "View RNA-SEQ Expression Data" links to complete lists, all downloadable.

## Sequence Section

Contains two to five subsections depending on species:

### Nucleotide Sequences
Presents available transcript and genomic sequences in various linked formats. Includes links to gene-associated NCBI GEO profiles and reference sequence information.

### Protein Sequences
Similar subsection for protein sequence data.

### Transcriptome (Rat only)
Provides links to:
- eQTL data
- Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis
- Tissue/strain expression data at Phenogen

### Protein Domains
Links to other genes containing domains found in the protein.

### Promoters (Human and Mouse only)
Lists positional and linked information about gene promoter(s).

### Damaging Variants (Dog only)
Provides searchable lists with positional information.

### Clinical Variants (Human only)
Provides searchable lists of mutations with links to report pages and descriptive information.

## Strain Variation Section (Rat only)
