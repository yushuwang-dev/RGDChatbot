# RGD Strains Help

## What is a Strain?

Rats used in a laboratory come from different sources; most are derived from *Rattus norvegicus*. An inbred strain is one whose background can be defined and is named by nomenclature conventions. Strains follow official naming guidelines with unique symbols combining letters and numbers plus a laboratory code.

## Strain Types in RGD

RGD maintains information on the following strain types:

- **Advanced intercross line** - Created by producing an F2 generation between two inbred strains, then intercrossing in each subsequent generation
- **Chromosome altered** - Strains grouped by alteration in chromosome structure
- **Coisogenic** - Inbred strains differing at only a single locus through mutation
- **Congenic** - Strains from repeated backcrosses to an inbred strain with selection for a particular marker from the donor strain
- **Conplastic** - Strains where the nuclear genome from one strain is crossed onto the cytoplasm of another (mitochondrial donor is always the female parent)
- **Consomic** - Strains produced by repeated backcrossing of a whole chromosome onto an inbred strain
- **Hybrid** - Progeny of two inbred strains, crossed in the same direction, genetically identical
- **Inbred** - Mated brother x sister for 20+ consecutive generations with average residual heterozygosity of 0.01
- **Mutant** - Animals with structural DNA changes (insertions, deletions, chromosomal rearrangements) generated spontaneously or artificially
- **Outbred** - Genetically undefined animals bred with unrelated individuals
- **Recombinant inbred** - Formed by crossing two inbred strains, followed by 20+ generations of brother-sister mating
- **Segregating inbred** - Inbred strains maintaining a particular allele or mutation in heterozygous state
- **Transchromosomal** - Strains carrying a chromosome or fragment from another species as a heritable entity
- **Transgenic** - Animals with a DNA fragment stably introduced into the germline via random insertion
- **Wild** - Rats captured in the wild

## Rat Strain Registration

RGD seeks community support for maintaining comprehensive strain listings. Researchers maintaining strains should:

1. Submit data via the online registration form
2. Receive a unique RGD ID for publication use
3. Contact RGD when developing new strains for naming assistance
4. Register ILAR codes through the National Academies

## Finding Strain Information

The Strain Search tool (accessible via the Data tab) enables searching by:
- Strain symbols
- Strain names
- Strain types
- Rat Strain Ontology browsing
- Keyword search
- Disease and phenotype-specific searches via "Find Models by Disease or Phenotype"

## Strain Report Page Sections

### 1. General Section

Contains basic strain information:

- **Symbol** - Official designation per nomenclature guidelines
- **Strain** - Official strain symbol
- **Substrain** - Official substrain designation with ILAR lab codes
- **Full Name** - Text name if applicable
- **RGD ID** - Unique registered identifier
- **Citation ID** - RRID (Research Resource Identifier) for publication citations
- **Ontology ID** - Strain ontology term identification number
- **Alleles** - Associated genetic markers
- **Also known as** - Previous symbols and synonyms
- **Type** - Strain category
- **Source** - Laboratory or vendor information
- **Origin** - Method of strain generation
- **Coat Color** - Physical characteristics
- **Inbred Generations** - Number of generations at curation time
- **Genetic status** - Strain genotype
- **Last known status** - Strain availability
- **Position** - Chromosomal positions of genetic markers

### 2. Annotation Section

#### Disease Annotations
Manually curated disease-strain associations from biomedical literature using Disease Ontology terms. Supported by evidence codes (IAGP, IDA, IMP) with reference identifiers.

#### Phenotype Annotations
Strain associations with mammalian phenotypes from the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology developed at MGI.

#### Phenotype Values via PhenoMiner
Quantitative phenotype measurements using the strain, retrievable from the RGD PhenoMiner tool. Options include viewing charts, downloading Excel spreadsheets, or viewing expanded data tables.

### 3. References Section
Lists all references used by RGD curators for strain annotation, linking to RGD Reference report pages with article abstracts and PubMed links.

### 4. Region Section

- **Strain QTL Data** - Lists QTLs identified using the strain with links to QTL report pages
- **Damaging Variants** - Reports damaging variants from the strain
- **Position Markers** - Visible only in congenic strains, listing SSLPs/genes/ESTs defining the introgressed segment

### 5. Additional Information Section

- **RGD Curation Notes (Strain Characteristics)** - Free-text information organized under headings including Anatomy, Behavior, Characteristics, Drugs and Chemicals, Infection, Immunology, Life Disease, Physiology and Biochemistry, Reproduction, and others
- **Nomenclature History** - Indicates naming dates and any symbol changes

## Strain Curation at RGD

RGD curates strains from:
- Rat QTL papers
- Researcher and vendor submissions
- Targeted disease curation projects
- PubMed literature on genome-modified rats and disease models
