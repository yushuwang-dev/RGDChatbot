# RGD Phenotypes and Models Help

## Overview

The "Phenotypes and Models" portal contains data related to rat strains, phenotypes, and disease models. Access it through the "Phenotypes and Models" tab or via the RGD home page.

## Main Sections

### 1. The Phenotypes and Models Home Page

The home page features image links providing access to five subsections:
- Meet Joe Rat
- Phenotypes
- PhenoMiner
- Strains & Models
- Strain Medical Records

### 2. Meet Joe Rat

#### Photos and Images
- **PhysGen Photo Archive** - Images of rat strains from the PhysGen Program for Genomic Applications with links to phenotypic data
- **Ratday** - Online PDF version of the RGD Rat Calendar
- **Community Submissions** - Links for photo submission and strain registration
- **For Sale** - Chart showing rat strain availability by vendors and repositories

#### Rats 101
- **Methods and Techniques** - Browse the Measurement Method Ontology and access related references
- **Strain Development** - Descriptions of techniques for developing various rat models with supporting references

#### Phylogenetics
Brief descriptions and links to three phylogenetic trees for inbred laboratory rat strains.

### 3. Phenotypes Section

Provides access to data from phenotyping experiments:
- **PGA** (PhysGen Program for Genomic Applications) data
- **NBRP** (National BioResource Project) data
- Experimental methods documentation

### 4. Strains & Models

#### RGD Strain Search
Search by symbol, ontology term, or keyword.

#### Strain Availability
Chart listing available strains with vendor/source links and parental strain information.

#### Disease Models
Lists rat strains serving as models for human diseases organized by disease category.

#### Animal Husbandry
Vendor/source and protocol links covering:
- Breeding
- Cages
- Colony Management Software
- Diagnostic and Genetic Testing
- Rat Food

### 5. PhenoMiner

Tool for mining quantitative phenotypic data. Uses four primary ontologies:
- Clinical Measurement Ontology
- Measurement Method Ontology
- Experimental Condition Ontology
- Rat Strain Ontology

See the [PhenoMiner Help](phenominer-help.md) document for detailed usage instructions.

### 6. Strain Medical Records

Links to standard phenotypic data for various rat strains with clickable strain symbols and text links.
