# RGD General Search Help

## Overview

The Rat Genome Database provides two primary search methods: keyword-based searches and coordinate-based object searches. The keyword function matches against locations, experimental data, descriptions, synonyms/aliases, database IDs, origin, name, trait, terms and term definitions, citations, titles, and abstracts.

An advanced search function called OLGA (Object List Generator and Analyzer) is available for more sophisticated queries.

## Keyword Search

### Process

Text is entered into a search box located in the page banner. Both full and partial terms work, though partial terms may return different result counts than complete terms.

### Results Matrix Structure

The top table summarizes objects found across species categories. Clicking numbers redirects to filtered object lists by species. The center table provides ontology results - selecting ontology names or numbers navigates to related object lists based on term and definition matches.

Results can be manually filtered using the left-hand menu. An "A" icon indicates available annotation information. A branch icon next to terms opens the ontology browser.

## Object Search (Coordinate-Based)

### Setup

Access object search via the "Search RGD" option from the Home drop-down menu. Select Species, Reference Assembly, and Chromosome using drop-down menus, then enter base pair coordinates in text fields.

### Results Matrix

Four tables return from object searches:

1. **Summary table** - Objects by category in the selected region
2. **Gene results** - Genes found in the specified genomic region
3. **QTL results** - QTLs overlapping the specified region
4. **SSLP results** - Simple Sequence Length Polymorphisms in the region

A download icon exports results as .csv files. A tools icon allows data export to RGD analysis tools.

## Additional Information

- The search is accessible from any RGD page via the search box in the banner
- Results are organized across ten RGD species: rat, mouse, human, chinchilla, dog, bonobo, thirteen-lined ground squirrel, pig, green monkey, and naked mole rat
- Ontology results include Gene Ontology, Disease Ontology, Pathway Ontology, Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, and others
- The OLGA tool provides advanced gene list generation and analysis capabilities beyond the basic search
