# RGD Evidence Codes Guide

## Overview

Evidence codes are attached to annotations to describe what type of evidence supports associations between genes, QTLs, strains, or other data objects and ontology/vocabulary terms. Many RGD evidence codes derive from the GO Consortium.

## Experimental Evidence Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **EXP** | Inferred by EXPeriment |
| **IAGP** | Inferred by Association of Genotype with Phenotype |
| **IDA** | Inferred from Direct Assay |
| **IED** | Inferred from Experimental Data |
| **IEP** | Inferred from Expression Pattern |
| **IGI** | Inferred from Genetic Interaction |
| **IMP** | Inferred from Mutant Phenotype |
| **IPI** | Inferred from Physical Interaction |

## Computational Analysis Evidence Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **IBA** | Inferred from Biological aspect of Ancestor |
| **IBD** | Inferred from Biological aspect of Descendant |
| **IGC** | Inferred from Genomic Context |
| **IKR** | Inferred from Key Residues |
| **IRD** | Inferred from Rapid Divergence |
| **ISO** | Inferred from Sequence Orthology |
| **ISS** | Inferred from Sequence or Structural Similarity |
| **RCA** | Inferred from Reviewed Computational Analysis |

## Author Statement Evidence Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **NAS** | Non-traceable Author Statement |
| **TAS** | Traceable Author Statement |

## Curator Statement Evidence Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **IC** | Inferred by Curator |
| **ND** | No biological Data available |

## Automatically-Assigned Evidence Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **IEA** | Inferred from Electronic Annotation |

## High Throughput Evidence Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **HTP** | Inferred from High Throughput exPeriment |
| **HMP** | Inferred from High throughput Mutant Phenotype |
| **HGI** | Inferred from High throughput Genetic Interaction |
| **HDA** | Inferred from High throughput Direct Assay |
| **HEP** | Inferred from High throughput Expression Pattern |

## Usage Notes

- Evidence codes appear in annotation sections across gene, QTL, and strain report pages
- Experimental evidence codes (EXP, IDA, IMP, etc.) represent the strongest evidence from direct laboratory experiments
- Computational analysis codes (ISO, ISS, etc.) indicate evidence inferred from bioinformatics analysis
- IEA (Inferred from Electronic Annotation) is automatically assigned by computational pipelines without manual curation
- High throughput codes (HTP, HMP, etc.) are used for large-scale experimental studies
