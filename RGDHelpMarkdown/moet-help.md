# RGD Multi-Ontology Enrichment Tool (MOET) Help

## Overview

MOET is RGD's ontology enrichment tool that analyzes gene lists to identify over-represented terms from RGD's ontologies (Disease, Pathway, Phenotype, GO, ChEBI). It can work with genes from any species or their orthologs in other species.

The MOET algorithm is based on the **hypergeometric test**.

## Access Points

MOET can be accessed through:
1. The RGD home page icon or "Analysis & Visualization" menu
2. Individual disease portal pages from "Diseases" and "Disease Portals"
3. RGD gene report pages

## Using MOET

### Input Interface

The interface allows users to:
- **Input gene lists** using acceptable identifier types (gene symbols, RGD IDs, etc.)
- **Select required species** from the dropdown menu
- **Select ontologies** from available options (Disease, Pathway, Phenotype, GO, ChEBI)
- **Enter genomic regions** of interest
- Click **"Continue"** to view results

## MOET Results Page

Results display includes:
- Number of annotated genes per term
- Reference genes
- P-value
- Bonferroni correction
- Odds ratio
- Downloadable results

### Features
- Modify p-value thresholds via dropdown
- View and modify graph displays
- Examine results across ontologies and species

## "Explore this Gene Set" Option

Users can click on annotated gene counts to open sub-lists, then resubmit these gene subsets to MOET for additional analysis. This allows iterative exploration of gene sets.

## Navigation to Other RGD Tools

The "All Analysis Tools" option provides access to additional analysis tools for gene lists, including:
- Gene Annotator
- GViewer
- OLGA
- InterViewer
- Variant Visualizer
