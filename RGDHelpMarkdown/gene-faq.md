# RGD Gene and Other FAQs

## General RGD Questions

### How does RGD acquire the information?
The Rat Genome Database is fully curated by staff scientists and data processing specialists who review all data. RGD processes information through customized pipelines regardless of original format. A nomenclature team collaborates with leaders in rat, mouse, and human model organism databases to ensure proper naming and symbol assignment.

### How often does new data appear on the RGD website?
New data uploads occur on the first and fifteenth of each month.

### How will I know when data is updated?
The Rat Community Forum keeps users informed about latest updates, modifications, and events within RGD. Users can also subscribe to GeneWatch and Term Watch features for specific update notifications.

### How do I cite RGD?
Citation examples are available through the "Citing RGD" link in the blue banner on the home page.

### What is an "RGD ID"?
Every object in RGD - genes, QTLs, sequences, ESTs, SSLPs, references, maps - receives a unique identification number. Users can search by RGD ID to retrieve specific web pages.

### Can I do a BLAST or sequence comparison in RGD?
RGD does not support BLAST internally but provides external links to BLAST tools on the Resource Links page under Rat Resources/NCBI Rat Genome Resources.

### How can I get bulk data downloads?
Data is available through the RGD FTP site (updated twice monthly), covering genes, ESTs, QTLs, maps, SSLPs, RH Map v3.4, and alleles. The FTP site is accessible from the Download section of the Data menu.

## Data Curation Questions

### How do you choose papers to curate?
RGD curates current articles covering genes, QTLs, strains, and mapping data, selected from a broad range of journals, with archive searching for thoroughness.

### How do I report data interpretation errors?
Contact RGD through the Contact Us link; changes typically appear within two weeks.

### How do I ensure my paper gets curated?
Inform RGD via the Contact Us link; curation results typically appear within three weeks.

### Can I submit my data to RGD?
Yes. Contact RGD for supplemental, new, or modified data submissions. Data can also be submitted through the Submit Data portal accessible from the main navigation.

## General Rat Questions

### What is the status of the rat sequencing project?
Status information is available through the Community tab, under Resource Links/Rat Resources/Baylor College of Medicine Rat Resources.

### Where can I order rat strains?
RGD stores data only, not live animals. Links through Programs for Genomic Applications connect to commercial suppliers. ILAR's Repositories of Laboratory Animal Models and Strains page also provides ordering resources. The Strain Availability chart on RGD lists available strains with vendor/source links.
