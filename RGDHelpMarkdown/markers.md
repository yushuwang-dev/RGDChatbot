# RGD Markers Help

## About Markers

### Definition and Historical Use
Markers are genomic tools used to localize genetic elements like Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) in relation to chromosomes. Before whole genome sequencing became available, researchers relied heavily on markers for this purpose.

### Simple Sequence Length Polymorphisms (SSLPs)
SSLPs, also known as microsatellite DNA, are 1-6 simple nucleotide repeat sequences which are highly polymorphic in length of repeat among strains or between individuals. They serve as genetic markers for genotyping.

### Current Applications
Despite complete rat, mouse, and human genome sequencing, SSLPs remain valuable. They help identify:
- QTL endpoints
- Introgressed DNA regions in congenic strains

This is due to readily available primer sequences and convenient polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology.

### Data Sources
RGD obtains marker information through multiple channels:
- Researcher submissions
- Literature curation
- NCBI's UniSTS database downloads for rat, mouse, and human data

### UniSTS Import Pipeline
UniSTS positions SSLPs on the genome by performing "ePCR" (electronic PCR) to find where the primers are homologous to chromosome and other sequences. RGD imports resulting chromosomal positions via the UniSTS Import Pipeline.

**Note:** NCBI has discontinued the UniSTS database. RGD retains previously imported data and continues to curate marker information from literature and researcher submissions.
