# RGD JBrowse Tracks Overview

## About JBrowse Tracks

JBrowse displays each type of data as a "track" - a horizontal region of the display which contains a specified kind of data. Each track includes a label indicating its data type and source information. Strain-specific variant tracks include abbreviations for the sequencing institution.

## Available Track Types

### Gene-related Tracks
Tracks displaying gene information including:
- RGD Genes and Transcripts
- RGD Transcript tracks
- Disease-related gene tracks
- Gene-Chemical Interaction tracks
- RNA-Seq Gene Prediction tracks

### RGD QTL and Strain Tracks
- QTL tracks showing quantitative trait loci positions
- Congenic strain tracks showing introgressed regions

### Reference Sequence Track
- DNA sequence display with six-frame translations
- Color-coded nucleotide visualization

### Synteny Tracks
- Cross-species synteny block comparisons
- Color-coded by matching chromosome

### Variant Tracks
- Strain-specific variant tracks (SNVs and indels)
- dbSNP and Ensembl variant data
- Marker/SSLP tracks

### RNA-Seq Based Tracks
- BAM alignment displays
- Gene prediction tracks from RNA-Seq data

## Quick Start Tips

1. Open JBrowse from any gene, QTL, or strain report page
2. Use the left sidebar to find and enable tracks by category
3. Use the filter box to search for specific track types
4. Click track title bars for context-specific menus
5. Use the Share button to create shareable URLs of your current view

For detailed information about each track type, see the dedicated help documents for each category.
