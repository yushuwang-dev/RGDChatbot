like to thank the organizers for 
giving me the opportunity to um
there we go giving me the opportunity 
to share with you a little bit about  
rgd's data and tools for translational research in  
otitis media and I would like to mention 
that I do not have any disclosures
I think you have to sit it all right I I I don't 
care either way yeah we can do it here because I  
guess you have to okay now we have appetite 
yes okay and I'm hoping that this will work
yeah and make me do it differently 
than I do in my rehearsals
okay um rgd is a multi-species resource for 
translational research and comparative genomics  
we house data for 10 mammalian species including 
human and chinchilla and just for those who use  
mouse and rat mouse and rat um we integrate 
data derived from expert literature curation  
with data imported from other sources we provide 
an extensive and well-rounded Corpus of genetic  
genomic disease and physiological data and 
we provide Innovative tools for data analysis
um our data and tools are accessible from the 
menu bar at the top of of most of the rgd pages  
data can also be accessed using the general search 
box or these targeted searches our tools can be  
accessed using the analysis and visualization 
links on the front page and the species icon  
link that are showed on the front page linked 
to informational landing pages for each species  
our species portals provide easy access to 
species-oriented information data and tools for  
instance this is the page for the human species 
the layout is essentially the same for all of  
the species portals although depending on the data 
and tools available for each there are differences  
so this is the uh the top of the page for 
chinchilla the top of the page gives information  
about chinchilla in this case and other species 
that are used as models of human disease  
below that there is uh information and links 
to chinchilla data to rgd tools with chinchilla  
already chosen as the the species to links to 
genome and Gene resources at rgd ncbi and ensemble  
and all of these links are also 
available in the right sidebar along with  
links to chinchilla Research 
Laboratories and selected Publications
hello there we go um
wait
okay
so I don't have time to go through everything 
that's shown on this page but I would like to  
highlight a couple of things and the first thing 
that I would like to highlight is the chinchilla  
phenominer phenominer is a data mining tool 
for quantitative phenotype measurement data  
for both rat and chinchilla the data in 
phenominer is a combination of curated data  
and direct submissions from researchers 
when you first access the the page you I
sorry got myself got myself in advance  
um yes the link for the chinchilla portal 
directly accesses the chinchilla FEMA Miner
in the phenominer selecting terms in the bottom 
section adds them to the corresponding bins in  
the top section data can be chosen on the 
basis of any or all of four criteria the  
source of the chinchilla clinical measurements 
measurement methods and experimental conditions  
once selections have been made click 
generate report to view the associated data  
on the results page there are three sections a 
graph a table and filters in the left sidebar all  
three of these work together so that filters 
that are selected on the left will remove  
bars from the graph and rows from the table and 
sorting the table reorders the bars in the graph  
colored by functionality gives you 
options for coloring the bars on the graph  
and here the table is sorted by condition 
and colored by the sex of the animals  
options are given to download all of the records 
that match your original search criteria or just  
a filtered set if filters have been applied 
so Switching gears a little bit rgd's General  
search searches across data types and across 
species so a search of otitis media will return  
genes in each of the species human variants 
from ncbi's clinvar database and links to  
vocabularies that rgd uses for functional 
annotations including the disease ontology
so if you click that link to the 
disease ontology you access a page  
that shows the 32 disease ontology 
terms that match the search criteria  
otitis media rgd uses ontologies for data 
standardization and ontology is a structured  
vocabulary which is often shown as an upside 
down tree structure with fewer more general  
terms toward the top and larger numbers of 
more specific terms as you move down the tree
the leaf icon on the search result page takes 
you to rgd's ontology browser which gives you  
easy functionality to go up the tree to the more 
uh general terms and down the tree to the more  
specific terms the a icon in the search results 
links to rgd's ontology report this is the top of  
the page for the ontology report for otitis media 
you'll see that it has information about the term  
including a definition a number of synonyms and 
links to related terms in other vocabularies  
and related information in other databases such 
as online mendelian inheritance in man or omen  
where possible a genome level view of the genes 
annotated to the term is shown for human rgd has  
annotations to otitis media for both genes 
and clinical variants as shown in this View  
for chinchilla most of the gene annotations are 
derived from orthologous genes in other species  
as indicated by this ISO or inferred 
from sequence orthology evidence code  
but rgd curators have reviewed the literature 
and made experimental annotations directly to  
chinchilla genes wherever possible rgd's 
disease portals provide Consolidated views  
of data related to 15 disease categories 
they're accessible from this diseases tab  
in the in the top menu bar if you click that 
it takes you to this disease portals landing  
page that shows you all 15 of the portals and 
I will use sensory organ disease as my example
when you access the portal the 
first thing that you can do is  
select a data type here disease is 
the one that is selected that's the  
default and you can also choose 
a species and I've chosen human
disease portals start with the most general 
term in the category in this case sensory  
system disease but you can use the embedded 
ontology browser to browse down the tree to  
get more specific disease terms the the portal 
leverages the structure of the ontology to show  
all of the objects in this case all of the genes 
annotated to the term and all of its children  
as selections are made this list 
of genes is updated on the Fly
for human the genome-wide view of Gene positions 
is shown there is an an embedded copy of the  
multi-ontology enrichment tool which I'll talk 
about in just a minute and links to additional  
information are provided at the bottom of the 
page and this same functionality is available  
for all species so if I go back up to the top 
and choose chinchilla when chinchilla is shown  
this the uh the list of genes that's shown is 
all of the genes in chinchilla annotated to  
otitis media or any of its more specific children  
if a an ontology is selected in the gene set 
enrichment section of the page as I've selected  
the pathway ontology here the list of genes is 
automatically submitted to the embedded moment  
tool for enrichment analysis in the results the 
table shows the list of enriched terms in the  
pathway ontology the number of genes in the in the 
list of genes that was that are annotated to each  
of those terms the uncorrected and bonferoni 
corrected p-values and um odd odds ratio for  
each term not surprisingly the most enriched 
terms for the pathway ontology for that list of  
otitis media genes is uh our our terms related 
to interleukin signaling and immune pathways
and the uh the graph shows the number of genes 
in blue and the p-value for each term in Orange
each gene in the in the list of genes in the 
disease portal links to its respective Gene  
report page so if I click this mucin 5B Gene 
symbol it will take me to the chinchilla Gene  
report page for mucin 5B which in turn links to 
that Gene's position in the jbrowse genome browser  
rgd has loaded genes from ncbi and Ensemble and 
rna-seq Bam alignments and coverage tracks from  
two projects uninfected and infected middle ear 
mucosa from the Medical College of Wisconsin and  
four tissues 14 tissues from samples provided 
by Dr Lauren bakaletz's group at the research  
institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital 
the first set shows that mucin 5B increases  
in expression from uninfected through days 3 
and 17 of strep infection the second set shows  
uh tissue specific expression for mucin 5B as 
shown here and this show this display shows the  
BAM alignments for two exons of mucin 5B from 
one of the uninfected middle ear mucosa samples  
so in conclusion this brief overview has only 
given you a small subset of the rich set of  
data data and tools that rgd provides for both 
clinical and translational researchers if you have  
questions or are interested in more information 
I'm available and I have some contact information  
here but I would like to to um to say that we have 
a couple of questions for the research community  
um the chinchilla genome is only assembled to 
the point of scaffolds as you can see here in  
The The J browse chromosome drop down um which 
is sufficient for some applications but for True  
comparative genomics or phylogeny or that sort 
of thing chromosome level assembly really would  
be required and so our questions are is there 
interest in improving the chinchilla genome  
assembly and if so would groups be willing 
to do additional genome sequencing to support  
chromosome level assembly and with that I would 
like to say thank you um I'd like to acknowledge  
the incredible rgd team and our funders and the 
researchers who contribute data and Faithfully  
use our website and data and especially Dr 
kirschner and Dr Hong here at the Medical College  
Who provided quantitative phenotype and rna-seq 
data and Dr bakelitz Who provided rna-seq data
