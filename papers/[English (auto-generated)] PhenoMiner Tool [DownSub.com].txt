foreign
okay
thank you I would like to thank the
organizers
um for allowing me to talk to you about
the improvements that we've made to
phenominer and to give you a little bit
of a sneak preview for what's actually
coming soon excuse me coming soon
um I work for the rat genome database
and we are the online resource for rat
data
um
pretty much worldwide
um so just to give you a brief
introduction to rgd's phenominer
um fetal Miner is a tool for
ontology-based storage and Mining of
quantitative phenotype data for the
laboratory rat
phenominer includes both data from high
throughput phenotyping projects which
come to us
relatively standardized and scientific
literature which comes to us completely
unstandardized
um so to allow comparisons across
studies as well as flexible and
intelligent querying phenominer uses
ontologies to express what was measured
in terms of the clinical measurement
ontology how it was measured using the
measurement methodontology under what
conditions it was measured using the
experimental condition ontology and in
what animals it was measured using the
rat strain ontology
the vertebrate trait ontology is also
used to group related measurements
within a study and phenominer can be
accessed through the phenotypes and
models tab in the menu at the top of any
rgd page or using the button on the
rgd's homepage
so thinking about some of the
limitations of our first iteration of
phenominer I started thinking about some
of the comments that we have heard and
some of the content comments that we
have made ourselves about phenominer and
they're things like the process for
selecting records to view is not
intuitive
once I've selected terms it's hard to
change my selections I can only view
results for one measurement at a time
even if I choose terms that use the same
units
what I can sort the results of that
table
oh but when I sort the table it doesn't
change anything in the graph that still
appears to be ordered randomly and
coloring the bars in the graph by
experimental condition is nice but I'd
like to choose what they're colored by
so to give you an a little bit of a of
an idea of what I'm talking about this
is the landing page of the original
phenominer and it was designed to be
flexible and and it is
but you come into this and you look at
it and maybe you don't quite know
exactly what it is that you need to do
so assuming that you figure it out you
select an ontology
and then you need to navigate through
the tree which means that you kind of
have to know what the ontology is
and there is a search but it basically
takes you to the tree and makes you
navigate through the tree
um and then once you've decided and
found the terms and and chosen them then
it takes you to another page which gives
you further options of things to do and
that basically makes it so that you're
going back and forth between
um the ontology tree selection pages and
pages that ask you what you want to do
next
in contrast to that
phenominer 2 2.0 uh in in that in this
new iteration of the tool all of the
components are on a single page
so the The Strain ontology loads
automatically when you first open it
um
but you can still start with any of the
ontologies by using the on uh using the
tabs in the lower right panel
and as selections are made in the bottom
panel
then they appear in the boxes above
so looking at the at those bottom panels
the lower left panel has a prominent
search box
and then below that an alphabetical list
of all of the terms from that ontology
that have data in phenominer
so you can scroll through the list of
terms or you can you can enter a term in
the search box once you enter a term in
the search box
um it Narrows the list below it to only
those things that match that that search
term
and then you have
this
um these uh select buttons and if you
choose a select button it puts the term
into the top box and also opens that uh
that region in the ontology tree in the
bottom right panel to make it easier for
you to refine the selection to add more
terms and then also if if you choose to
take terms away and if you do want to
take terms away then you can easily do
that by either
[Music]
um
unchecking the Box in that lower panel
or clicking the X beside that term in
the top box to just remove that from the
from the search
okay there we go
okay so
um all of this as I mentioned all of the
selections are made within the same
screen and all of the changes and
additions and and subtractions that you
make are all shown in real time
and you can switch back and forth
between the ontologies using the tabs in
the bottom right panel
and at each step options are limited by
the the selections that you've made so
if you've chosen some rat strains the
only options that you'll have for
choosing clinical measurements will be
one will be terms that have been used
with those strains in phenominer so you
don't end up going down a path and then
ending up at the very end of it with no
data
so um the options are limited by your
previous selections
and as you go through
you can choose
terms from any or all of the ontologies
that are listed if you choose not to
make any selections for one of the
ontologies so for instance if I choose
rat strains and clinical measurements
and and experimental conditions but I
don't want to limit my options for ex
for measurement method I don't have to
make any choices for that and it will
show me all of the results for any of
the measurement methods that match the
other Search terms that I've that I've
used and so once you have your list of
of filters that you want to use then you
can just hit that generate report button
and it will take you to
the result page
so the phenominer 2.0 result page
consists of three parts a graph a list
of filters and a table of results
and you're looking at that and thinking
ic2
I only see a list of filters and a table
and that's because if measurements if
you if you choose measurements that use
more than one unit
so in this case I've chosen heart rate
which would be beats per minute and
several blood pressure terms which would
be millimeters of mercury if you choose
measurements that use more than one unit
it hides the graph until you um use the
filters on the left hand side
to filter that down to measurements that
only use a single unit
so
once once I do that in this case I've
I've chosen to only show my my blood
pressure measurements then the graph
appears
and the filters the graph and the table
are all interconnected
so things that you do in one will affect
all of the rest of them
uh you can use you can select filters on
the left to limit what's shown in the
graph in the table
selected filters are also shown above
the the graph as well as in the list to
the left
and you can remove filters by either
unchecking the boxes on the left or by
clicking the X
um for that filter in the at the top of
the page
and
I can choose I can choose anyone or or
more of the filters and the one on here
on the on the uh on the left is you can
remove all of the filters at once and it
will take you back to your initial
search
results
so if I remove the the measurements for
mean arterial blood pressure
then it just shows that the bars that
correspond to systolic blood pressure
and diastolic blood pressure
so one of the things that was requested
was the ability to change uh the
coloring in the graph and so phenominer
2.0 is more interactive and it does
include a color by function the default
is for it to be colored by experimental
conditions
but you can change that and and have it
colored by strain or phenotype method or
uh the sex of the animals
so if I change this particular graph and
color it by phenotype then I get this
graph where I've got just the um
I have just two colors and there's a
drop down legend that tells me that the
yellow bars are diastolic blood pressure
and the purple bars are systolic blood
pressure
so the the tool also allows you to sort
the table and sorting the table reorders
the bars in the graph
and then you can use that kind of
functionality so for instance using the
color by phenotype and sort by value in
this case and it's easy to see the at a
glance the mix of diastolic and systolic
blood pressure values so one might have
thought naively that all of the
diastolic blood pressure values would
all be on one side and all the systolic
ones would be on the other side but here
it's easy to see that some of the
systolic blood pressure values are
actually lower than most of the
diastolic blood pressure values and some
of the diastolic blood pressure values
are actually higher than a number of the
systolic blood pressure values
foreign
so if I if I go back to a graph that's
actually looking at mean arterial blood
pressure where data for individual rats
has been submitted to us the graph shows
not only the average but also the
individual values
that have been submitted so looking at
this graph for mean arterial blood
pressure you can see that some of the
bars include red dots that indicate the
values for individual animals so you get
to see not only the average or the mean
you also get to see the distribution of
the values that went into making that
mean
so you can Mouse over the the bar and it
will bring up
um a pop-up with details about the
average value for that sample of rats
under those conditions
and you can Mouse over any of those dots
to see the details for that individual
rat measurement
so those values are also
um you're also able to view those values
in the table if if a row of the table
has uh individual values it will show
the average value and also an option in
the last column to view the individual
values so if you click the view values
in that last column it shows you the
list of uh individual animal IDs and the
the individual measurement values that
go with each of those
at present
um we the way the table is set up you
can't download all of the individual
values but that's high on our list of
things to do to be able to not only see
not only download not only see on the on
the website but also to be able to
download not only averages but also the
individual values so that you have the
raw data that went into
um making those making those values
um
so
all that to say that data from the query
can be downloaded
um at least the average values can be
downloaded
um a button for download all records is
displayed on the pages for both
unfiltered and filtered queries and then
for the filtered queries there's also an
option to download just the table view
records so just the records that you
have filtered down to as you've
um played with it played with the
filters
so
um that is our
our soon to come new phenominer tool
um if you are interested in seeing it uh
if you want to stop me at lunch I can
actually show you that the tool itself
and and kind of give you a run through
it's not out on the website yet but it
will be very soon we're we're just doing
final testing we wanted to make sure
that we tested it really well before we
sent it out into the wild
um but it's it's coming soon and with
that I will say thank you and I'd like
to acknowledge the incredible team that
we have of both scientists science
scientific curators and Developers
who produce all of this stuff
um acknowledge our funders the national
heart lung and Blood Institute and all
of the researchers who contribute data
and Faithfully use our website and our
data and with that I will take questions
thank you
foreign
blood pressure data I saw that there
were two bars that had the exact same
values and they were listed as the same
con strain condition
is it do individual Studies have their
own representation how or how are you
grouping things
um
to make things easier to see
yes
the I'm I'm
trying to make sure that I that I speak
correctly the
if the if the values come from different
studies they will show up as different
measurements
um
yes
and and one of the things that that
you can see in the pop-up it's not quite
as obvious in the graph is you could
have
[Music]
um
if if the if there was no no difference
between uh an animal that was fasted an
animal that wasn't fasted they might
show up as the same with the same value
but they would be two different bars
because they have two different
conditions
so
thank you
so I have a question so
and I recognize that this is probably
beyond the scope of what you're doing
but
um there are no what I would commonly
refer to I guess as phenotype calls so
there's no stats or saying well this
this or at under this condition has high
blood pressure for example if we use
your example there were you know bars of
different heights so is the expectation
then and you would need the individual
data to do this but users would then be
able to download the data and run their
own statistical analyzes and things like
that yes that's that's exactly the idea
and we we do have
um qualitative
curation that goes along with this so in
addition to the actual values
um if if there was a study that was done
and they found that this partic under
these conditions this particular rat was
hypertensive then we would have the
qualitative
um phenotype measurement that says that
it it has increased blood pressure or
its hypertension has hypertension or
whatever
in addition to the actual
um
specific values okay and so what what
terms are you then using so those
phenotype calls that I guess you're
mining from the literature and so
relying on the peer-reviewed data and
yes to to make those calls
are you using specific ontologies for
those yes and are they cross mapped to
say the mouse or human ontologies yes in
any way okay yes great we use the we use
the uh the mammalian phenotype ontology
for for the Rex
um and
those are also met to the human
phenotype ontology which um and we
actually have data for human so you
would in rgd you would be able to look
across the across the orthologs and say
you know rat has this phenotype Mouse
has this phenotype human has that
phenotype because they're not shared
across the across the species but we
have the data for for all of those
species so you'd be able to just within
rgd be able to compare all of them great
thank you any other questions
is there a plan to expand this so you
know like the mouse site has gene
expression and activity of
pre-transgenic lines and things like
that is that the future goal for this
site as well yes absolutely
um we're hoping now now that we're we're
getting a little bit more usable
interface for the Phoenix the
quantitative
phenotypes
um we want to be able to uh add in
genotype data so that you can connect
the phenotype the specific phenotype and
the genotype together and also the
quantitative expression measurements and
be able to to link you know phenotype
expression and uh
genotype
uh be able to link all of those three
together so yes that is that that's the
plan
hey well thank you so much like if you
could join me in thanking all of the
speakers from this morning
and enjoy your lunch no
no no oh wait
